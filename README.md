## Steps
1. Use `crawl.py` to crawl the reviews from the conference website.
2. Use `main.py` to generate the meta review and do analysis.

Note the results in [Tutorial.md](Tutorial.md) are based on papers on the first page of NeurIPS 2022 on OpenReview.
There are 50 accepted papers and 50 rejected papers. Put their html pages in the `accepted` and `rejected` folders respectively under `cache` folder.
